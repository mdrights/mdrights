Google, the University of Washington, and Brave New Software have teamed up to give ‘net users a better way to securely access content on the web. It’s called uProxy, and it’s a bit like a peer-to-peer VPN hosted by your trusted friends.

When it’s complete, you’ll be able to download uProxy as an extension for both Chrome and Firefox. It’s currently in a closed beta, and access is being limited to those with “a strong technical background” so that all the kinks can be worked out.

That’s extremely important, because uProxy isn’t intended as a way to let your cousin in Canada watch Hulu via your fiber link in the U.S. uProxy is aimed at those who don’t enjoy free, unfettered access to all of the Internet’s information. Circumventing censorship and protecting privacy are the primary goals.

uProxy traffic is fully encrypted, but it’s not an anonymity tool like Tor. Traffic is routed from point A to point B — there’s no guarantee that IP addresses are invisible when using uProxy. There needs to be a high level of trust between individuals sharing a connection. You probably don’t want someone pulling down illegal content through your cable pipe, after all.

It’s much more limited than a VPN, too. Since uProxy is a browser extension, it’s only capable of routing traffic when the destination browser is up and running. uProxy can also only handle web traffic in Chrome and Firefox. It can’t do anything to secure other internet-connected apps.

For people dealing with government-imposed censorship and state-sponsored snooping, uProxy will no doubt prove to be a useful tool. In countries where that’s not the case, it sounds like uProxy will make an excellent way for you to circumvent corporate firewall restrictions — and possibly let your Canadian friends watch Hulu.

Just bear in mind that if your trusted friend happens to live in the U.S., there’s a decent chance the NSA will be snooping on the other side.
