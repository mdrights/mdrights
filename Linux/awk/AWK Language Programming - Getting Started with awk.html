The basic function of <CODE>awk</CODE> is to search files for lines (or other
units of text) that contain certain patterns.  When a line matches one
of the patterns, <CODE>awk</CODE> performs specified actions on that line.
<CODE>awk</CODE> keeps processing input lines in this way until the end of the
input files are reached.

Programs in <CODE>awk</CODE> are different from programs in most other languages,
because <CODE>awk</CODE> programs are <STRONG>data-driven</STRONG>; that is, you describe
the data you wish to work with, and then what to do when you find it.
Most other languages are <STRONG>procedural</STRONG>; you have to describe, in great
detail, every step the program is to take.  When working with procedural
languages, it is usually much
harder to clearly describe the data your program will process.
For this reason, <CODE>awk</CODE> programs are often refreshingly easy to both
write and read.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX42"></A>
<A NAME="IDX43"></A>
When you run <CODE>awk</CODE>, you specify an <CODE>awk</CODE> <STRONG>program</STRONG> that
tells <CODE>awk</CODE> what to do.  The program consists of a series of
<STRONG>rules</STRONG>.  (It may also contain <STRONG>function definitions</STRONG>,
an advanced feature which we will ignore for now.
See section <A HREF="gawk_14.html#SEC129">User-defined Functions</A>.)  Each rule specifies one
pattern to search for, and one action to perform when that pattern is found.

</P>
<P>
Syntactically, a rule consists of a pattern followed by an action.  The
action is enclosed in curly braces to separate it from the pattern.
Rules are usually separated by newlines.  Therefore, an <CODE>awk</CODE>
program looks like this:

</P>

<PRE>
<VAR>pattern</VAR> { <VAR>action</VAR> }
<VAR>pattern</VAR> { <VAR>action</VAR> }
...

The <CODE>awk</CODE> language has evolved over the years. Full details are
provided in section <A HREF="gawk_18.html#SEC173">The Evolution of the <CODE>awk</CODE> Language</A>.
The language described in this book
is often referred to as "new <CODE>awk</CODE>."

</P>
<P>
Because of this, many systems have multiple
versions of <CODE>awk</CODE>.
Some systems have an <CODE>awk</CODE> utility that implements the
original version of the <CODE>awk</CODE> language, and a <CODE>nawk</CODE> utility
for the new version.  Others have an <CODE>oawk</CODE> for the "old <CODE>awk</CODE>"
language, and plain <CODE>awk</CODE> for the new one.  Still others only
have one version, usually the new one.<A NAME="DOCF2" HREF="gawk_foot.html#FOOT2">(2)</A>

</P>
<P>
All in all, this makes it difficult for you to know which version of
<CODE>awk</CODE> you should run when writing your programs.  The best advice
we can give here is to check your local documentation. Look for <CODE>awk</CODE>,
<CODE>oawk</CODE>, and <CODE>nawk</CODE>, as well as for <CODE>gawk</CODE>. Chances are, you
will have some version of new <CODE>awk</CODE> on your system, and that is what
you should use when running your programs.  (Of course, if you're reading
this book, chances are good that you have <CODE>gawk</CODE>!)

</P>
<P>
Throughout this book, whenever we refer to a language feature
that should be available in any complete implementation of POSIX <CODE>awk</CODE>,
we simply use the term <CODE>awk</CODE>.  When referring to a feature that is
specific to the GNU implementation, we use the term <CODE>gawk</CODE>.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC12" HREF="gawk_toc.html#TOC12">How to Run <CODE>awk</CODE> Programs</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX46"></A>
<A NAME="IDX47"></A>
There are several ways to run an <CODE>awk</CODE> program.  If the program is
short, it is easiest to include it in the command that runs <CODE>awk</CODE>,
like this:

</P>

<PRE>
awk '<VAR>program</VAR>' <VAR>input-file1</VAR> <VAR>input-file2</VAR> ...
</PRE>

<P>
where <VAR>program</VAR> consists of a series of patterns and actions, as
described earlier.
(The reason for the single quotes is described below, in
section <A HREF="gawk_3.html#SEC13">One-shot Throw-away <CODE>awk</CODE> Programs</A>.)

</P>
<P>
When the program is long, it is usually more convenient to put it in a file
and run it with a command like this:

</P>

<PRE>
awk -f <VAR>program-file</VAR> <VAR>input-file1</VAR> <VAR>input-file2</VAR> ...
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="SEC13" HREF="gawk_toc.html#TOC13">One-shot Throw-away <CODE>awk</CODE> Programs</A></H3>

<P>
Once you are familiar with <CODE>awk</CODE>, you will often type in simple
programs the moment you want to use them.  Then you can write the
program as the first argument of the <CODE>awk</CODE> command, like this:

</P>

<PRE>
awk '<VAR>program</VAR>' <VAR>input-file1</VAR> <VAR>input-file2</VAR> ...
</PRE>

<P>
where <VAR>program</VAR> consists of a series of <VAR>patterns</VAR> and
<VAR>actions</VAR>, as described earlier.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX48"></A>
This command format instructs the <STRONG>shell</STRONG>, or command interpreter,
to start <CODE>awk</CODE> and use the <VAR>program</VAR> to process records in the
input file(s).  There are single quotes around <VAR>program</VAR> so that
the shell doesn't interpret any <CODE>awk</CODE> characters as special shell
characters.  They also cause the shell to treat all of <VAR>program</VAR> as
a single argument for <CODE>awk</CODE> and allow <VAR>program</VAR> to be more
than one line long.

</P>
<P>
This format is also useful for running short or medium-sized <CODE>awk</CODE>
programs from shell scripts, because it avoids the need for a separate
file for the <CODE>awk</CODE> program.  A self-contained shell script is more
reliable since there are no other files to misplace.

</P>
<P>
section <A HREF="gawk_4.html#SEC24">Useful One Line Programs</A>, presents several short,
self-contained programs.

</P>
<P>
As an interesting side point, the command

</P>

<PRE>
awk '/foo/' <VAR>files</VAR> ...
</PRE>

<P>
is essentially the same as

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX49"></A>

<PRE>
egrep foo <VAR>files</VAR> ...
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="SEC14" HREF="gawk_toc.html#TOC14">Running <CODE>awk</CODE> without Input Files</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX50"></A>
<A NAME="IDX51"></A>
You can also run <CODE>awk</CODE> without any input files.  If you type the
command line:

</P>

<PRE>
awk '<VAR>program</VAR>'
</PRE>

<P>
then <CODE>awk</CODE> applies the <VAR>program</VAR> to the <STRONG>standard input</STRONG>,
which usually means whatever you type on the terminal.  This continues
until you indicate end-of-file by typing <KBD>Control-d</KBD>.
(On other operating systems, the end-of-file character may be different.
For example, on OS/2 and MS-DOS, it is <KBD>Control-z</KBD>.)

</P>
<P>
For example, the following program prints a friendly piece of advice
(from Douglas Adams' <CITE>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</CITE>),
to keep you from worrying about the complexities of computer programming
(<SAMP>`BEGIN'</SAMP> is a feature we haven't discussed yet).

</P>

<PRE>
$ awk "BEGIN { print \"Don't Panic!\" }"
-| Don't Panic!
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX52"></A>
<A NAME="IDX53"></A>
This program does not read any input.  The <SAMP>`\'</SAMP> before each of the
inner double quotes is necessary because of the shell's quoting rules,
in particular because it mixes both single quotes and double quotes.

</P>
<P>
This next simple <CODE>awk</CODE> program
emulates the <CODE>cat</CODE> utility; it copies whatever you type at the
keyboard to its standard output. (Why this works is explained shortly.)

</P>

<PRE>
$ awk '{ print }'
Now is the time for all good men
-| Now is the time for all good men
to come to the aid of their country.
-| to come to the aid of their country.
Four score and seven years ago, ...
-| Four score and seven years ago, ...
What, me worry?
-| What, me worry?

<A NAME="IDX54"></A>
<A NAME="IDX55"></A>
<A NAME="IDX56"></A>
<A NAME="IDX57"></A>
Sometimes your <CODE>awk</CODE> programs can be very long.  In this case it is
more convenient to put the program into a separate file.  To tell
<CODE>awk</CODE> to use that file for its program, you type:

</P>

<PRE>
awk -f <VAR>source-file</VAR> <VAR>input-file1</VAR> <VAR>input-file2</VAR> ...
</PRE>

<P>
The <SAMP>`-f'</SAMP> instructs the <CODE>awk</CODE> utility to get the <CODE>awk</CODE> program
from the file <VAR>source-file</VAR>.  Any file name can be used for
<VAR>source-file</VAR>.  For example, you could put the program:

</P>

<PRE>
BEGIN { print "Don't Panic!" }
</PRE>

<P>
into the file <TT>`advice'</TT>.  Then this command:

</P>

<PRE>
awk -f advice
</PRE>

<P>
does the same thing as this one:

</P>

<PRE>
awk "BEGIN { print \"Don't Panic!\" }"
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX58"></A>
<A NAME="IDX59"></A>
which was explained earlier (see section <A HREF="gawk_3.html#SEC14">Running <CODE>awk</CODE> without Input Files</A>).
Note that you don't usually need single quotes around the file name that you
specify with <SAMP>`-f'</SAMP>, because most file names don't contain any of the shell's
special characters.  Notice that in <TT>`advice'</TT>, the <CODE>awk</CODE>
program did not have single quotes around it.  The quotes are only needed
for programs that are provided on the <CODE>awk</CODE> command line.

</P>
<P>
If you want to identify your <CODE>awk</CODE> program files clearly as such,
you can add the extension <TT>`.awk'</TT> to the file name.  This doesn't
affect the execution of the <CODE>awk</CODE> program, but it does make
"housekeeping" easier.

</P>

<A NAME="IDX62"></A>
<A NAME="IDX63"></A>
<A NAME="IDX64"></A>

</P>
<P>
Once you have learned <CODE>awk</CODE>, you may want to write self-contained
<CODE>awk</CODE> scripts, using the <SAMP>`#!'</SAMP> script mechanism.  You can do
this on many Unix systems<A NAME="DOCF3" HREF="gawk_foot.html#FOOT3">(3)</A> (and someday on the GNU system).

</P>
<P>
For example, you could update the file <TT>`advice'</TT> to look like this:

</P>

<PRE>
#! /bin/awk -f

BEGIN    { print "Don't Panic!" }
</PRE>

<P>
After making this file executable (with the <CODE>chmod</CODE> utility), you
can simply type <SAMP>`advice'</SAMP>
at the shell, and the system will arrange to run <CODE>awk</CODE> <A NAME="DOCF4" HREF="gawk_foot.html#FOOT4">(4)</A> as if you had typed <SAMP>`awk -f advice'</SAMP>.

</P>

<PRE>
$ advice
-| Don't Panic!
</PRE>

<P>
Self-contained <CODE>awk</CODE> scripts are useful when you want to write a
program which users can invoke without their having to know that the program is
written in <CODE>awk</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX65"></A>
<A NAME="IDX66"></A>
Some older systems do not support the <SAMP>`#!'</SAMP> mechanism. You can get a
similar effect using a regular shell script.  It would look something
like this:

</P>

<PRE>
: The colon ensures execution by the standard shell.
awk '<VAR>program</VAR>' "$@"
</PRE>

<P>
Using this technique, it is <EM>vital</EM> to enclose the <VAR>program</VAR> in
single quotes to protect it from interpretation by the shell.  If you
omit the quotes, only a shell wizard can predict the results.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>"$@"</CODE> causes the shell to forward all the command line
arguments to the <CODE>awk</CODE> program, without interpretation.  The first
line, which starts with a colon, is used so that this shell script will
work even if invoked by a user who uses the C shell.  (Not all older systems
obey this convention, but many do.)

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC17" HREF="gawk_toc.html#TOC17">Comments in <CODE>awk</CODE> Programs</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX67"></A>
<A NAME="IDX68"></A>
<A NAME="IDX69"></A>
<A NAME="IDX70"></A>
<A NAME="IDX71"></A>

</P>
<P>
A <STRONG>comment</STRONG> is some text that is included in a program for the sake
of human readers; it is not really part of the program.  Comments
can explain what the program does, and how it works.  Nearly all
programming languages have provisions for comments, because programs are
typically hard to understand without their extra help.

</P>
<P>
In the <CODE>awk</CODE> language, a comment starts with the sharp sign
character, <SAMP>`#'</SAMP>, and continues to the end of the line.
The <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> does not have to be the first character on the line. The
<CODE>awk</CODE> language ignores the rest of a line following a sharp sign.
For example, we could have put the following into <TT>`advice'</TT>:

</P>

<PRE>
# This program prints a nice friendly message.  It helps
# keep novice users from being afraid of the computer.
BEGIN    { print "Don't Panic!" }
</PRE>

<P>
You can put comment lines into keyboard-composed throw-away <CODE>awk</CODE>
programs also, but this usually isn't very useful; the purpose of a
comment is to help you or another person understand the program at
a later time.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC18" HREF="gawk_toc.html#TOC18">A Very Simple Example</A></H2>

<P>
The following command runs a simple <CODE>awk</CODE> program that searches the
input file <TT>`BBS-list'</TT> for the string of characters: <SAMP>`foo'</SAMP>.  (A
string of characters is usually called a <STRONG>string</STRONG>.
The term <STRONG>string</STRONG> is perhaps based on similar usage in English, such
as "a string of pearls," or, "a string of cars in a train.")

</P>

<PRE>
awk '/foo/ { print $0 }' BBS-list
</PRE>

<P>
When lines containing <SAMP>`foo'</SAMP> are found, they are printed, because
<SAMP>`print $0'</SAMP> means print the current line.  (Just <SAMP>`print'</SAMP> by
itself means the same thing, so we could have written that
instead.)

</P>
<P>
You will notice that slashes, <SAMP>`/'</SAMP>, surround the string <SAMP>`foo'</SAMP>
in the <CODE>awk</CODE> program.  The slashes indicate that <SAMP>`foo'</SAMP>
is a pattern to search for.  This type of pattern is called a
<STRONG>regular expression</STRONG>, and is covered in more detail later
(see section <A HREF="gawk_5.html#SEC25">Regular Expressions</A>).
The pattern is allowed to match parts of words.
There are
single-quotes around the <CODE>awk</CODE> program so that the shell won't
interpret any of it as special shell characters.

</P>
<P>
Here is what this program prints:

</P>

<PRE>
$ awk '/foo/ { print $0 }' BBS-list
-| fooey        555-1234     2400/1200/300     B
-| foot         555-6699     1200/300          B
-| macfoo       555-6480     1200/300          A
-| sabafoo      555-2127     1200/300          C
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX72"></A>
<A NAME="IDX73"></A>
<A NAME="IDX74"></A>
<A NAME="IDX75"></A>
In an <CODE>awk</CODE> rule, either the pattern or the action can be omitted,
but not both.  If the pattern is omitted, then the action is performed
for <EM>every</EM> input line.  If the action is omitted, the default
action is to print all lines that match the pattern.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX76"></A>
<A NAME="IDX77"></A>
Thus, we could leave out the action (the <CODE>print</CODE> statement and the curly
braces) in the above example, and the result would be the same: all
lines matching the pattern <SAMP>`foo'</SAMP> would be printed.  By comparison,
omitting the <CODE>print</CODE> statement but retaining the curly braces makes an
empty action that does nothing; then no lines would be printed.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC19" HREF="gawk_toc.html#TOC19">An Example with Two Rules</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX78"></A>

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>awk</CODE> utility reads the input files one line at a
time.  For each line, <CODE>awk</CODE> tries the patterns of each of the rules.
If several patterns match then several actions are run, in the order in
which they appear in the <CODE>awk</CODE> program.  If no patterns match, then
no actions are run.

</P>
<P>
After processing all the rules (perhaps none) that match the line,
<CODE>awk</CODE> reads the next line (however,
see section <A HREF="gawk_10.html#SEC105">The <CODE>next</CODE> Statement</A>,
and also see section <A HREF="gawk_10.html#SEC106">The <CODE>nextfile</CODE> Statement</A>).
This continues until the end of the file is reached.

</P>
<P>
For example, the <CODE>awk</CODE> program:

</P>

<PRE>
/12/  { print $0 }
/21/  { print $0 }
</PRE>

<P>
contains two rules.  The first rule has the string <SAMP>`12'</SAMP> as the
pattern and <SAMP>`print $0'</SAMP> as the action.  The second rule has the
string <SAMP>`21'</SAMP> as the pattern and also has <SAMP>`print $0'</SAMP> as the
action.  Each rule's action is enclosed in its own pair of braces.

</P>
<P>
This <CODE>awk</CODE> program prints every line that contains the string
<SAMP>`12'</SAMP> <EM>or</EM> the string <SAMP>`21'</SAMP>.  If a line contains both
strings, it is printed twice, once by each rule.

</P>
<P>
This is what happens if we run this program on our two sample data files,
<TT>`BBS-list'</TT> and <TT>`inventory-shipped'</TT>, as shown here:

</P>

<PRE>
$ awk '/12/ { print $0 }
&#62;      /21/ { print $0 }' BBS-list inventory-shipped
-| aardvark     555-5553     1200/300          B
-| alpo-net     555-3412     2400/1200/300     A
-| barfly       555-7685     1200/300          A
-| bites        555-1675     2400/1200/300     A

-| fooey        555-1234     2400/1200/300     B
-| foot         555-6699     1200/300          B
-| macfoo       555-6480     1200/300          A
-| sdace        555-3430     2400/1200/300     A
-| sabafoo      555-2127     1200/300          C

-| Jan  21  36  64 620
-| Apr  21  70  74 514
</PRE>

<P>
Note how the line in <TT>`BBS-list'</TT> beginning with <SAMP>`sabafoo'</SAMP>
was printed twice, once for each rule.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC20" HREF="gawk_toc.html#TOC20">A More Complex Example</A></H2>

<P>
Here is an example to give you an idea of what typical <CODE>awk</CODE>
programs do.  This example shows how <CODE>awk</CODE> can be used to
summarize, select, and rearrange the output of another utility.  It uses
features that haven't been covered yet, so don't worry if you don't
understand all the details.

</P>

<PRE>
ls -lg | awk '$6 == "Nov" { sum += $5 }
             END { print sum }'
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX79"></A>
<A NAME="IDX80"></A>
This command prints the total number of bytes in all the files in the
current directory that were last modified in November (of any year).
(In the C shell you would need to type a semicolon and then a backslash
at the end of the first line; in a POSIX-compliant shell, such as the
Bourne shell or Bash, the GNU Bourne-Again shell, you can type the example
as shown.)

</P>
<P>
The <SAMP>`ls -lg'</SAMP> part of this example is a system command that gives
you a listing of the files in a directory, including file size and the date
the file was last modified. Its output looks like this:

</P>

<PRE>

</PRE>

<P>
The first field contains read-write permissions, the second field contains
the number of links to the file, and the third field identifies the owner of
the file. The fourth field identifies the group of the file.
The fifth field contains the size of the file in bytes.  The
sixth, seventh and eighth fields contain the month, day, and time,
respectively, that the file was last modified.  Finally, the ninth field
contains the name of the file.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX81"></A>
<A NAME="IDX82"></A>
The <SAMP>`$6 == "Nov"'</SAMP> in our <CODE>awk</CODE> program is an expression that
tests whether the sixth field of the output from <SAMP>`ls -lg'</SAMP>
matches the string <SAMP>`Nov'</SAMP>.  Each time a line has the string
<SAMP>`Nov'</SAMP> for its sixth field, the action <SAMP>`sum += $5'</SAMP> is
performed.  This adds the fifth field (the file size) to the variable
<CODE>sum</CODE>.  As a result, when <CODE>awk</CODE> has finished reading all the
input lines, <CODE>sum</CODE> is the sum of the sizes of files whose
lines matched the pattern.  (This works because <CODE>awk</CODE> variables
are automatically initialized to zero.)

</P>
<P>
After the last line of output from <CODE>ls</CODE> has been processed, the
<CODE>END</CODE> rule is executed, and the value of <CODE>sum</CODE> is
printed.  In this example, the value of <CODE>sum</CODE> would be 80600.

</P>
<P>
These more advanced <CODE>awk</CODE> techniques are covered in later sections
(see section <A HREF="gawk_9.html#SEC97">Overview of Actions</A>).  Before you can move on to more
advanced <CODE>awk</CODE> programming, you have to know how <CODE>awk</CODE> interprets
your input and displays your output.  By manipulating fields and using
<CODE>print</CODE> statements, you can produce some very useful and impressive
looking reports.

Most often, each line in an <CODE>awk</CODE> program is a separate statement or
separate rule, like this:

</P>

<PRE>
awk '/12/  { print $0 }
     /21/  { print $0 }' BBS-list inventory-shipped
</PRE>

<P>
However, <CODE>gawk</CODE> will ignore newlines after any of the following:

</P>

<PRE>
,    {    ?    :    ||    &#38;&#38;    do    else
</PRE>

<P>
A newline at any other point is considered the end of the statement.
(Splitting lines after <SAMP>`?'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`:'</SAMP> is a minor <CODE>gawk</CODE>
extension.  The <SAMP>`?'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`:'</SAMP> referred to here is the 
three operand conditional expression described in
section <A HREF="gawk_8.html#SEC84">Conditional Expressions</A>.)

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX85"></A>
<A NAME="IDX86"></A>
<A NAME="IDX87"></A>
If you would like to split a single statement into two lines at a point
where a newline would terminate it, you can <STRONG>continue</STRONG> it by ending the
first line with a backslash character, <SAMP>`\'</SAMP>.  The backslash must be
the final character on the line to be recognized as a continuation
character.  This is allowed absolutely anywhere in the statement, even
in the middle of a string or regular expression.  For example:

</P>

<PRE>
awk '/This regular expression is too long, so continue it\
 on the next line/ { print $1 }'
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX88"></A>
We have generally not used backslash continuation in the sample programs
in this book.  Since in <CODE>gawk</CODE> there is no limit on the
length of a line, it is never strictly necessary; it just makes programs
more readable.  For this same reason, as well as for clarity, we have
kept most statements short in the sample programs presented throughout
the book.  Backslash continuation is most useful when your
<CODE>awk</CODE> program is in a separate source file, instead of typed in on
the command line.  You should also note that many <CODE>awk</CODE>
implementations are more particular about where you may use backslash
continuation. For example, they may not allow you to split a string
constant using backslash continuation.  Thus, for maximal portability of
your <CODE>awk</CODE> programs, it is best not to split your lines in the
middle of a regular expression or a string.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX89"></A>
<A NAME="IDX90"></A>
<STRONG>Caution: backslash continuation does not work as described above
with the C shell.</STRONG>  Continuation with backslash works for <CODE>awk</CODE>
programs in files, and also for one-shot programs <EM>provided</EM> you
are using a POSIX-compliant shell, such as the Bourne shell or Bash, the
GNU Bourne-Again shell.  But the C shell (<CODE>csh</CODE>) behaves
differently!  There, you must use two backslashes in a row, followed by
a newline.  Note also that when using the C shell, <EM>every</EM> newline
in your awk program must be escaped with a backslash. To illustrate:

</P>

<PRE>
% awk 'BEGIN { \
?   print \\
?       "hello, world" \
? }'
-| hello, world
</PRE>

<P>
Here, the <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`?'</SAMP> are the C shell's primary and secondary
prompts, analogous to the standard shell's <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`&#62;'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>awk</CODE> is a line-oriented language.  Each rule's action has to
begin on the same line as the pattern.  To have the pattern and action
on separate lines, you <EM>must</EM> use backslash continuation--there
is no other way.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX91"></A>
When <CODE>awk</CODE> statements within one rule are short, you might want to put
more than one of them on a line.  You do this by separating the statements
with a semicolon, <SAMP>`;'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
This also applies to the rules themselves.
Thus, the previous program could have been written:

</P>

<PRE>
/12/ { print $0 } ; /21/ { print $0 }
</PRE>

<P>
<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> the requirement that rules on the same line must be
separated with a semicolon was not in the original <CODE>awk</CODE>
language; it was added for consistency with the treatment of statements
within an action.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC22" HREF="gawk_toc.html#TOC22">Other Features of <CODE>awk</CODE></A></H2>

<P>
The <CODE>awk</CODE> language provides a number of predefined, or built-in variables, which
your programs can use to get information from <CODE>awk</CODE>.  There are other
variables your program can set to control how <CODE>awk</CODE> processes your
data.

</P>
<P>
In addition, <CODE>awk</CODE> provides a number of built-in functions for doing
common computational and string related operations.

</P>
<P>
As we develop our presentation of the <CODE>awk</CODE> language, we introduce
most of the variables and many of the functions. They are defined
systematically in section <A HREF="gawk_11.html#SEC108">Built-in Variables</A>, and
section <A HREF="gawk_13.html#SEC123">Built-in Functions</A>.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX92"></A>
<A NAME="IDX93"></A>
You might wonder how <CODE>awk</CODE> might be useful for you.  Using
utility programs, advanced patterns, field separators, arithmetic
statements, and other selection criteria, you can produce much more
complex output.  The <CODE>awk</CODE> language is very useful for producing
reports from large amounts of raw data, such as summarizing information
from the output of other utility programs like <CODE>ls</CODE>.  
(See section <A HREF="gawk_3.html#SEC20">A More Complex Example</A>.)

</P>
<P>
Programs written with <CODE>awk</CODE> are usually much smaller than they would
be in other languages.  This makes <CODE>awk</CODE> programs easy to compose and
use.  Often, <CODE>awk</CODE> programs can be quickly composed at your terminal,
used once, and thrown away.  Since <CODE>awk</CODE> programs are interpreted, you
can avoid the (usually lengthy) compilation part of the typical
edit-compile-test-debug cycle of software development.

</P>
<P>
Complex programs have been written in <CODE>awk</CODE>, including a complete
retargetable assembler for eight-bit microprocessors (see section <A HREF="gawk_22.html#SEC228">Glossary</A>, for
more information) and a microcode assembler for a special purpose Prolog
computer.  However, <CODE>awk</CODE>'s capabilities are strained by tasks of
such complexity.

</P>
<P>
If you find yourself writing <CODE>awk</CODE> scripts of more than, say, a few
hundred lines, you might consider using a different programming
language.  Emacs Lisp is a good choice if you need sophisticated string
or pattern matching capabilities.  The shell is also good at string and
pattern matching; in addition, it allows powerful use of the system
utilities.  More conventional languages, such as C, C++, and Lisp, offer
better facilities for system programming and for managing the complexity
of large programs.  Programs in these languages may require more lines
of source code than the equivalent <CODE>awk</CODE> programs, but they are
easier to maintain and usually run more efficiently.
