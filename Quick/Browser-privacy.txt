How to disable WebRTC in Firefox?

In short: Set "media.peerconnection.enabled" to "false" in "about:config".

Explained:

    Enter "about:config" in the firefox address bar and press enter.
    Press the button "I'll be careful, I promise!"
    Search for "media.peerconnection.enabled"
    Double click the entry, the column "Value" should now be "false"
    Done. Do the WebRTC leak test again.

If you want to make sure every single WebRTC related setting is really disabled change these settings:

    media.peerconnection.turn.disable = true
    media.peerconnection.use_document_iceservers = false
    media.peerconnection.video.enabled = false
    media.peerconnection.identity.timeout = 1

Now you can be 100% sure WebRTC is disabled.
