Introduction

This checklist is to be used to audit a Unix (Solaris) environment. This
checklist is of a technical nature and does not include manual procedures
to be reviewed e.g. Reviewing the physical security of the Solaris server.

While all attempts have been made to make this checklist as comprehensive
as possible, it can’t be relied upon to be all-inclusive.

Elements to consider prior to applying this checklist:
 • Other operating systems performing some of functions: This checklist
   needs to be tailored to the different circumstances of the network
   environment especially when there are other network operating systems
   within the architecture performing specific functions e.g. when an NT
   operating system performs the authentication of users and the application
   is hosted on the Solaris box.
 • Other utilities: Where possible we have made mention of the various
   utilities to be used to enhance the operations and security of the
   Solaris box, however it is quite impossible to make mention of all
   freeware, shareware or commercial products. Thus, when the auditor is
   reviewing the security of the Solaris box, he must ascertain what
   utilities are being run on the Solaris system and ascertain the security
   impact of using such utilities. A good source to ascertain such security
   impacts is to review vendor documents accompanying commercial products or
   visit their sites (for freeware/shareware as well) and review security
   documents posted there.
 • Findings and data sensitivity: When reporting any findings the auditor
   should take into account the risk element i.e. is the finding so
   substantial as to directly affect the availability, confidentiality and
   integrity of sensitive information. Thus, prior to performing the audit
   it is important to ascertain what data/applications are stored on the
   Solaris box. The risk committee/department can give the auditor
   indications of the risk pertaining to certain data. In some instances the
   finding may seem significant, however it may not be affect organisation
   due to the risk associated with that data e.g. To secure telephone
   extensions of the organisation.
   This step is fundamental to provide management with meaningful report.
 • Mitigating Controls: The review of Solaris can’t be done in a vacuum
   without considering database and application controls.
   For example if an application calls the Solaris server using the root id.
   This seems to be a significant finding. However, the logical access
   controls for the application may be so granular that this risk is
   mitigated and thus this is not a significant finding. This is a
   mitigating control.
   Weak security on the Solaris box may be mitigated by strong controls in
   either the database or the application.
 • Peripheral Devices: This checklist has not made provision for
   environments where other devices like modems have been connected to the
   Solaris box.
 • Practicality of checklist: The checklist highlights a list of security
   configurations to achieve the most secure configuration. However these
   are nice to haves and may not be feasible in the real world. Management
   may deem certain secure configurations to not be cost effective and thus
   may purposely omit them. The cost may not only relate to monetary terms
   but also to inefficiencies created by poor response times due to a
   particular configuration. The auditor must however, make certain that the
   omission of certain secure configurations are commensurate with the
   purpose and the risk associated with the Solaris server in question.

The most important item to ascertain before applying the checklist is the
purpose of the server. What the server is used for directly affects how you
would apply this checklist. Where possible we have indicated the controls
where the purpose of the server is necessary to determine the most secure
configuration e.g. The purpose of the server is important to determine what
services are to be commented out in the inetd.conf file


Checklist


|No.  |Control                                                    |
|     |Ascertain whether the latest patches of the operating      |
|     |system is installed.                                       |
|     |Determine procedures to update the patches:                |
|     |If downloaded ascertain if downloaded from a secure site   |
|     |Ascertain if patches are updated whenever there is a new   |
|     |vulnerability                                              |
|     |Determine if the patch is tested in a test environment     |
|     |before being rolled out to the live environment            |
|     |Ascertain whether the minimum core software is installed to|
|     |reduce exploits.                                           |
|     |Ascertain the amount of space allocated to the various     |
|     |partitions. The amount of space allocated depends on the   |
|     |purpose of the server e.g. A logging server would have more|
|     |space allocated to /var.                                   |
|     |/opt and /usr – application installation                   |
|     |/ - root partition                                         |

|     |Removing unnecessary services:                             |
|     |Review the inetd.conf file to ascertain what services are  |
|     |enabled. Services are disabled by the pound sign (#) in    |
|     |front of the line. Again the auditor needs to ascertain the|
|     |purpose of the server prior to ascertaining whether the    |
|     |necessary services have in fact been commented out.        |
|     |Depending on the function of the server comment out the    |
|     |following services:                                        |
|     |ftp                                                        |
|     |tftp                                                       |
|     |systat                                                     |

|     |Startup scripts                                            |
|     |Review the /etc/rc2.d and /etc/rc3.d files to ensure that  |
|     |unnecessary startup scripts have been stopped from running |
|     |(lowercase k or s stops a script). Again depending on the  |
|     |role of the server the following should be stopped:        |
|     |automounter /etc/rc2.d/S74autofs                           |
|     |Sendmail /etc/rc2.d/S88sendmail and /etc/rc1.d/K57sendamil |
|     |RPC /etc/rc2.d/ S71rpc                                     |
|     |SNMP /etc/rc2.d/S76snmpdx                                  |
|     |NFS server /etc/rc3.d/S15nfs.server                        |
|     |NFS client /etc/rc2/S73nfs.client                          |
                                     2.
|No.  |Control                                                    |
|     |Logging                                                    |
|     |In environments with multiple Solaris boxes, ensure that   |
|     |there is a central logging/syslog server. Review the       |
|     |/etc/hosts file on both the host to be logged and the      |
|     |syslog server to ensure that it contains the correct       |
|     |entries to the correct syslog/host servers.                |
|     |If using a central syslog server to log remote machine     |
|     |incidents, ensure that the traffic sent to the syslog      |
|     |server is encrypted using ppp rpm                          |
|     |Ensure that sufficient space has been allocated to the /var|
|     |file if the server is a syslog server or even if there is  |
|     |only one server in the environment in which case logging is|
|     |performed locally.                                         |
|     |Ensure that the following items are being logged:          |
|     |SU attempts                                                |
|     |Failed login attempts                                      |
|     |Last command – who logged in, when and from where          |
|     |System events                                              |
|     |Review the /etc/syslog.conf file to ensure that at a       |
|     |minimum error priorities and above are logged on all the   |
|     |facilities.                                                |
|     |Ensure that the permissions on the/var/adm/loginlog are 600|
|     |and are owned by root and groupsys.                        |
|     |Ensure that appropriate monitors are in place to notify    |
|     |system administrators of unauthorised activities. Tools    |
|     |such as Swatch and Logcheck can be used for this purpose   |
|     |and can forward alerts via e-mail.                         |
|     |Ensure that the permissions on utmp are set to –rw-r- - r- |
|     |- .                                                        |
|     |Verify the existence of the wtmp file by using the ls - la |
|     |command. Ensure that the permissions on wtmp is set to 644.|
|     |Ensure that the btmp files exist.                          |
|     |SSH:                                                       |
|     |Review the /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny files to   |
|     |ensure that the authorised relationships are established.  |
|     |Ensure that the .ssh/identity file has permissions of 600  |
|     |and owned by root.                                         |
|     |Ensure that all r programs have been removed and ssh has   |
|     |been configured to replace r programs.                     |
|     |Review security procedures to maintain the security of the |
|     |passphrases at the server and workstations.                |
|     |TCPWrapper                                                 |
|     |Review the /etc/hosts.allow file to ensure that it is      |
|     |configured to disallow everyone and then allows the        |
|     |authorised hosts.                                          |
|     |Determine the process to change rules in TCP Wrapper and   |
|     |whether tools like tcpdchk (check configuration and reports|
|     |problems) and tcpdmatch (what happens when rules are       |
|     |deployed) are used.                                        |
|     |Ensure that a TCP Wrapper banner message has been created  |
|     |with the appropriate legal wording.                        |
|     |Ensure that the –DPARANOID option is turned on.            |
|     |Ensure that TCP Wrapper has been configured to query the   |
|     |client’s IDENT server.                                     |
|     |Ensure that the Makefile has been edited to include the    |
|     |-DKILL_IP_OPTIONS.                                         |
|     |Ensure that the permissions for all TCP Wrapper files are  |
|     |read, read and execute only access (modes 755 &555).       |
                                     3.
|No.  |Control                                                    |
|     |Backups                                                    |
|     |Ensure that backups are performed frequently. A review of  |
|     |the cron file should give an indication of the frequency of|
|     |backups. Ensure that not only the file system and data is  |
|     |backed up but also the configuration files e.g. Inetd.conf.|
|     |If a remote server is being backed, ensure that SSH(refer  |
|     |to 6 above) to secure the trust relationship between the   |
|     |local and the remote machine.                              |
|     |Ensure that the backups are tested regularly via restore   |
|     |procedures to ensure that they have been written to the    |
|     |offline media correctly.                                   |
|     |In the event that TCPWrapper is not used, ensure that a    |
|     |warning has been created in /etc/issue file and that it has|
|     |been added to /etc/motd file.                              |
|     |Ascertain how often vulnerability analysis are run using   |
|     |tools like SATAN, SAINT, ASET, ESM Omniguard and ISS System|
|     |scanner. Determine if fixes to the vulnerabilities have    |
|     |been implemented and whether they were tested on in a test |
|     |environment prior to rolling put in the live environment.  |
|     |NFS Security                                               |
|     |Ensure that the most recent NFS patches are installed.     |
|     |Ensure that sensitive files are exported read only         |
|     |Ensure that file systems are exported to a restricted set  |
|     |of hosts                                                   |
|     |Ensure that NFS is configured to only accept requests from |
|     |privileged system programs                                 |
|     |Ensure that the file system is not exported to an exporting|
|     |server or to a netgroup which includes the exporting server|
|     |Ensure that there is no reference to localhost in          |
|     |/etc/exports file                                          |
|     |Ensure that exports are to fully qualified domain names to |
|     |prevent spoofing..                                         |
|     |Ensure that all suid code is kept on one filesystem and is |
|     |exported with no root access.                              |
|     |Ensure that all other filesystems are mounted with nosuid. |
|     |Ensure that the satmon directories are not world writable  |
|     |Ensure that the portmap/rpcbind program does not forward   |
|     |mount requests                                             |
|     |Ensure that the NIS netgroup does not contain empty host   |
|     |fields (treated as wildcards and grant access to any host  |
|     |via mountd daemon).                                        |
|     |Ensure that TCP and UDP ports 2049(nfs) & 111(portmap) are |
|     |blocked on routers and firewalls                           |
|     |Ascertain what authentication service is being used. If it |
|     |is the Diffie-Hellman AUTH_DH, review procedures for the   |
|     |protection of keys                                         |
|     |To aid in auditing the security of NFS the following tools |
|     |can be used:                                               |
|     |Showmount – displays filenames exported by a given host    |
|     |SATAN – examine remote hosts by probing services like NFS. |
|     |NFSWatch – monitor NFS requests to any given machine or to |
|     |the entire local network                                   |
|     |NFS tracer – to monitor NFS traffic                        |
|     |NFSbug – test hosts for well known NFS problems/bugs.      |
|     |Sendmail Security                                          |
|     |Ensure that local routers and firewalls restrict access to |
|     |TCP port 25.                                               |
|     |Ensure that the most recent patch of sendmail is installed.|
|     |Review SmtpGreetingMessage to ensure that the SMTP login   |
|     |message omits version information.                         |
|     |Ensure that the proper ownerships and file permissions are |
|     |applied to sendmail binary, configuration file, sendmail   |
|     |scripts and other sendmail directories and files.          |

|     |NIS Security                                               |
|     |Ensure that the latest NIS patches are applied.            |
|     |Ensure the use of compatibility mode for NIS.              |
|     |Ensure that the netgroup enforcement has been implemented  |
|     |to restrict user access to systems.                        |
|     |Ensure that access to NIS maps is restricted by            |
|     |/var/yp/securenets.                                        |
|     |Ensure that access to the portmap service is restricted by |
|     |the use of versions of portmap and rpcbind that support    |

|     |Ensure that encrypted passwords from the NIS maps are      |
|     |hidden by installing shadowing through the use of          |
|     |passwd.adjunct.                                            |
|     |SETUID and SETGID                                          |
|     |Ensure that the setuid/setgid is removed for services which|
|     |the system is not using e.g. for UUCP the following should |
|     |be removed:                                                |
|     |/usr/bin/ct – used for managing dial in sessions on        |
|     |/dev/tty allocated for UUCP dial outs                      |
|     |/usr/bin/cu – UUCP , modem line to call out to another     |
|     |system.                                                    |
|     |/usr/bin/uucp – unix to unix copy command. Not required    |
|     |unless for UUCP dial up networking.                        |
|     |Ensure that a master list of authorised setuid and setgid  |
|     |is created and procedures are in place to check that there |
|     |are no unauthorised changes.                               |
|     |Ensure that IPForwarding disabled.                         |
|     |Tripwire                                                   |
|     |Ascertain which version of Tripwire is being used. If      |
|     |earlier than 2, ensure that the database is stored to an   |
|     |off line medium.                                           |
|     |If version 2, don’t worry about the off line media storage |
|     |of the database.                                           |
|     |Determine how often rpm is run to determine changes to     |
|     |files, and steps taken if there is an unauthorised change. |
|     |Security management:                                       |
|     |If rdist is being used to tighten security on multiple     |
|     |Solaris servers, then ensure that SSH is installed to      |
|     |encrypt transfers.                                         |
|     |Ensure that the latest patches for rdist are installed.    |
|     |Miscellaneous                                              |
|     |Review the /etc/default/inetinit file to ensure that the   |
|     |TCP initial sequence number generation parameters are set  |
|     |to TCP_STRONG_ISS=2.                                       |
|     |Review the /etc/system file to ensure that the following   |
|     |two lines have been included to protect against buffer     |
|     |overflow attacks:                                          |
|     |Set noexec_user_stack=1                                    |
|     |Set noexec_user_stack_log=1                                |
|     |Ensure that root can only access the console by reviewing  |
|     |the /etc/default/login file to ensure that                 |
|     |CONSOLE=/dev/console/ is not commented out.                |
|     |Review the /etc/shadow file to ensure that the sys, uucp,  |
|     |nuucp, smtp, and listen accounts are disabled (disabled if |
|     |there is a LK in the password field for these accounts.    |
|     |Ensure that the sendmail packages of SUNWsndmr and         |
|     |SUNWsndmu are removed.                                     |
|     |Ensure that the group write permission of the /etc         |
|     |directory file is removed.                                 |
|     |Ensure that routing has been disabled.                     |
|     |Ensure that the /etc/hosts.equiv,/.rhosts are removed.     |
|     |Ensure that the Stop-A abort sequence is disabled by       |
|     |reviewing the /etc/default/kbd. (KEYBOARD_ABORT=DISABLED)  |
|     |Ensure that EEPROM security is enabled.                    |
|     |Ensure that shadowing is enabled.                          |
|     |Ensure that the password aging is at least 45 days. Account|
|     |Policy - /etc/default/passwd file – password aging.        |
|     |Ensure that the following accounts are locked “LK” in the  |
|     |encrypted password field in the /etc/shadow file:          |
|     |adm                                                        |
